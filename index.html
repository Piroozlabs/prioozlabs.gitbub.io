      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          TipTax is a Canadian sales-tax and tip calculator. This privacy policy
          explains what the app stores or transmits based solely on the
          published source code.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data-we-collect">
        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          TipTax only collects information necessary to run the calculator
          features, all stored directly on your device.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculator history:</strong> up to 20 saved entries
            containing the subtotal, discounts, tax amounts, total, province
            code, tip settings, split count, rounding mode, GST/PST/HST rates,
            and timestamps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preferences:</strong> your chosen province or territory,
            preferred language (English or French), theme (light or dark),
            layout style, and whether onboarding was completed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan status:</strong> whether you are in the trial,
            ad-supported, or Pro plan and when your free trial started, so the
            app knows when to show ads or the paywall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase activity:</strong> product identifiers
            (pro_monthly, pro_yearly) exchanged with Apple App Store or Google
            Play Billing when you buy or restore TipTax Pro. TipTax itself does
            not store receipts beyond runtime.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feedback email helper:</strong> when you tap Send Feedback
            the app opens your mail client with a pre-filled subject line
            addressed to piroozlabs@gmail.com. You control whether any email is
            actually sent.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="data-usage">
        <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Saved entries let you reopen earlier bills, preload inputs, and
            render the history list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preferences make sure your selected province, language, theme, and
            layout return automatically on every launch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan status and subscription checks determine whether ads appear,
            whether a paywall decision is required, and whether TipTax should
            remove ads for Pro members.
          </li>
          <li>
            Purchase information is transmitted only to the native billing APIs
            to finish or restore subscriptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feedback links simply start an email in your own mail app; nothing
            leaves TipTax unless you send it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          TipTax does not have its own backend services or analytics SDKs, so no
          other data transmission occurs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="third-party-services">
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          TipTax integrates a few third-party SDKs that provide ads, billing,
          and communication helpers. Those providers may process their own
          diagnostic data according to their policies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK:</strong> loads banner and app-open
            ads using the AdMob unit IDs defined in the code and manifest.
            Google may receive device identifiers, IP address, and ad
            interaction data per its policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Play Billing and Apple In-App Purchase:</strong>
            handle subscription queries, purchase flows, and restorations when
            you choose TipTax Pro. These services process the necessary store
            account and transaction identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Platform email client:</strong> launched via url_launcher
            only when you opt to send feedback.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="data-storage">
        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          All storage happens locally on your device. While TipTax does not
          transmit the stored fields to its own servers, keeping your device
          secure remains important.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All persistent data listed above is saved locally in
            SharedPreferences on your device without additional encryption.
          </li>
          <li>
            History entries are capped at 20 and can be deleted manually from
            the history screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            No TipTax-owned servers receive your information, although
            third-party SDKs communicate securely with their respective
            providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because SharedPreferences is device-level storage, anyone with
            access to an unlocked device could read it. Protect your device with
            OS-level security if the data is sensitive.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="choices">
        <h2>6. Your Choices and Consent</h2>
        <p>
          You remain in control of what data TipTax stores. The options below
          describe how to manage consent and remove data if needed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using TipTax means you consent to the local storage behaviors
            described here.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can decline to enter data, avoid saving history, or clear
            existing history at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Locale, province, theme, and layout settings are adjustable from the
            drawer whenever you like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upgrading to TipTax Pro (or restoring a prior subscription) removes
            ads and limits Google Mobile Ads processing.
          </li>
          <li>Feedback email is optional and under your control.</li>
          <li>
            Uninstalling TipTax or clearing its app storage removes all stored
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="children">
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          TipTax does not target children and contains no child-specific
          features. If a parent or guardian believes a child has saved data in
          the app, uninstalling or clearing the app removes it.
        </p>

          Future updates may adjust these practices. Review the policy whenever
          you install a new version and watch release notes for privacy-related
          changes.

          This privacy policy is based solely on the TipTax source code
